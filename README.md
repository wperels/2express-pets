Instructions forked from LearnWebCode/express-pets to use express.
After cloning / downloading these files you'll need to rename the env.txt file to instead be named .env
In your .env file you'll need to enter your MongoDB connection string value, as well as your Cloudinary Cloud Name, Cloudinary API Key, and Cloudinary API Secret values.
In your command-line run the npm install command to pull in the dependencies.
You can start the project locally by running the npm run dev command.
You can then visit the project in your web browser by visiting localhost:3000 or whatever port number you might have chosen in your .env file.# Nextjs-pets
